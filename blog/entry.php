              Energy conservation;Medicine and prolonging life;Global communication;new technologies;Globalization;Security and counter terrorism ....all the great innovations of 21st century in these fields have changed the world ! But what about the Gender Gap that is still existing in STEM fields??? As the 21st century is one of the  rapid innovations and progresses, wouldn't closing the gender gap be one of the greatest accomplishments of all time? Why women still aren't well or equally represented in the STEM fields??</p>
              <p>
              The gender  gap between male and female engineers has narrowed. But there are still eight times as many men as women in the industry. What characterizes a career in math or in science that keeps them male-dominated even today, when women, at least on paper, share the same freedoms as men? What is it about, say, physics that attracts men and repels women? Is testosterone a required variable for understanding inertia or balancing the Schrödinger equation? Why are there so few women?</p>
              <p>
              There is no easy way to explain why more women are not encouraged to follow STEM career paths. Some arguments assign blame to the media for fostering an image that scientists and mathematicians in our society are male. Other views place the blame on educators for directing men into those "manly" fields and women into traditionally acceptable "womanly" fields such as teaching and nursing, which supposedly fit a woman's nurturing nature. Whatever the reasons, and no matter how complex they prove to be, they cannot be justified. There is no legitimate excuse for anyone not being encouraged to follow his or her passions in life because of gender. There are many factors that might influence a girl or young woman's decision to pursue a particular career path. While the majority of studies show no differences in STEM ability, a large divide in perceived competence starts as early as age five. One study found that by the spring of kindergarten, boys have a greater willingness to learn math concepts. By third grade, boys rate their own math competence higher than girls do, even though no differences in actual performance are found. If girls do not expect to succeed in math and other STEM domains as early as elementary school, it is not surprising that by college, their interests have shifted to fields in which they feel more confident.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout history, women have achieved tremendous accomplishments in the traditionally male-dominated STEM fields. Women worked on the Manhattan Project, contributed to our understanding of DNA, discovered radium, and helped design and build the Golden Gate Bridge, just to name a few accomplishments. In addition to mastering difficult subjects and techniques of experimentation, however, these women also had to overcome the obstacle of a bias against their participation in and restricted access to STEM disciplines. Although that hurdle is less overt today, biases and restrictions still prevent women from choosing STEM career paths in large numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overcoming the lack of exposure is one of the main obstacles standing in the way of creating more gender balance in the STEM fields. So, what can professionals do to help? Act as a mentor. Especially for women, teaming with a mentor is a career strategy that can bring huge benefits in male-dominated work environments like science. The majority of successful women time and time again credit their participation in some sort of mentorship program for dramatically helping them to reach their career goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Science is about critical thinking and taking risks in order to unveil knowledge; it is about learning all we can. Leveling the playing field will help crush the social stigma that says careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are for boys only. Living in the 21st century, it seems pretty odd to see this as a myth, but there are many people who actually believe that STEM fields are  devoid of the fairer sex. In reality, girls are just as likely as boys to take up a STEM course for their bachelor’s degree. After all, how else will we find the next Lillian Gilbreth or Marie Curie?
